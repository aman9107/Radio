### Cons

- Not meant to be fully customizable
- Cannot have more than 75 streams in total
- Support restricted to [GuildVoice](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/VoiceChannel:Class) channel only</li>

## Configuration

- Configure the bot from [`./src/config.mts`](./src/config.mts)

- If you're familiar with ts, go for it, simple js in esm is available otherwise.
